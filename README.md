### CURVETOPIA: A Journey into the World of Curves
Our mission is to identify, regularize, and beautify curves in 2D Euclidean space. Weâ€™ll start by focusing on closed curves and progressively work with more complex shapes. This project will also cover symmetry and curve completion techniques.
All the input images would be in a directory named as 'input'.And within input we have directory with name 'polyline-curve' which contains all the curves given in the problem statement along with their desired solutions.
